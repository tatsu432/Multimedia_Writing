    <h2>The history of tourism and its potential</h2>
    <p id="passage1">
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
        Traveling is one of the pleasures for many people regardless of 
        nationality in the tedious days. In the middle ages and early 
        modern, most of the traveling purpose was a pilgrimage, and many 
        people could not visit distant places because traveling cost much 
        money. In modern, thanks to the development of transportation 
        like cars, many people could enjoy traveling, but still, it was 
        not common amusement. Now, traveling has become more popular. 
        The growth rate of the traveling and tourism industry in the 
        world has exceeded that of the economy in the world for nine years 
        (World Travel & Tourism Council, 2019). Especially in Japan, tourism 
        has become one of the vital elements of the economy. Not only Asian 
        people but also European and Americans visit Japan for a trip, and 
        there are many reasons they choose to travel to Japan. To make 
        Japanese tourism more fascinating, the Japanese government should 
        promote the following things: healthy and delicious food, the hot 
        spring, historical sightseeing spots, Kendama, and real-life anime 
        locations.
    </p>

    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p id="passage1">
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
        One of the things the Japanese government should promote to attract 
        many people to Japan is delicious and healthy food. Compared to 
        Chinese cuisine like Mapo Tofu, which uses various seasonings, 
        most Japanese dishes make the most of the original
    <figure class="figure1">
            <img class="img1" src="..\images\ichiju_sansai.jpg" alt="Ichiju-Sansai">
            <br>
            <p class="pcenter">
                <a class="a1" href="..\HTML\Ichiju_Sansai.html"

            </p>
    </figure>
        taste of local 
        ingredients. Besides, Japanese people have traditionally emphasized 
        the style of <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\Ichiju_Sansai.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ichiju-Sansai (Figure1)</a>, which means one soup and three dishes
        consisting of a variety of seasonal vegetables. Therefore, Japanese 
        meals are tasty and good for health. For example, sushi is a famous 
        Japanese food in the world. Japan is an insular country surrounded 
        by ocean and has optimum fishing

        grounds, so Japanese dishes incorporate 
        various fishes. According to the medical center of the Toho University 
        (2011), fish contains <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\EPA_DHA.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosatetraenoic 
        acid (EPA) (Figure2)</a> in comparison with meats . DHA and EPA decrease the amount 
        of bad cholesterol and are helpful to deal with lifestyle diseases like 
        obesity and arteriosclerosis that are spreading in the USA and Europe. 
        About 71 percent of people in the world passed away because of lifestyle 
        diseases triggered by the spread of fast food (World Health Organization, 
        2018). Therefore, Japanese food can improve people’s health in developed 
        countries. Japanese tourism will be more captivating for those interested 
        in healthy life if the government promotes the greatness of palatable 
        Japanese food.
    </p>

    <h2>Hot Spring</h2>
    <p id="passage1">
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
        Another thing the Japanese government should propel to increase the number 
        of tourists is the hot spring. Tourists can be exhausted by a long time 
        on the plane or train. Moreover, unfamiliar local climate may fatigue 
        the visitors. However, one of the purposes of traveling is to chill out. 
        Hence, after people enjoy visiting a historical site or shopping and come 
        back to the hotel or Japanese Inn, people can make themselves at home 
        and relieve the weariness of the travel by taking a hot spring bath 
        with beautiful scenery in Japan. Taking a hot spring makes people’s 
        blood flow smoothly and has an effect of detoxification by improving 
        metabolism (Japanese Ministry of the Environment, 2020). Although foreigners 
        who have a tattoo sometimes cannot get into the hot spring because of 
        the traditional Japanese image that people with a tattoo have a connection 
        with anti-social forces, the Japanese government declares that restricting 
        tattoos is not appropriate in response to Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic 
        (Miyano, 2019). Therefore, more and more foreign tourists can enjoy 
        traditional hot springs.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Sightseeing Spot</h2>
    <p id="passage1">
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
        Historical sightseeing spot is one of the contents of tourism that the 
        Japanese administration ought to promote. One of the chief purposes of 
        tourism is to experience

        and touch local traditional cultures. In Japan, 
        Kyoto is famous for traditional Japanese temples and shrines. There is a
        limitation of the height and color of architecture in Kyoto by the Kyoto 
        scenery treaty to keep the good old town. By looking at the <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\Kyoto_Tokyo_GIS.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preservation 
        district of historic buildings and Priorities area of the plan for the 
        maintenance and improvement of historic scenic beauty (Figure3)</a>, Kyoto 
        emphasizes the importance of historical buildings compared to Tokyo. 
        For example, though the color of <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\McDonald.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McDonald's billboards (Figure4)</a> consists of red and yellow, most of them in 
        Kyoto are brown to synchronize the shops with a historical view. Thus, 
        foreigners can fully undergo the traditional modest culture. In addition 
        to old streets and houses, many temples and shrines are worth visiting

        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinkaku-Ji (Gold Temple) (Figure5)</a> is one of 
        the most famous temples in Japan. Yoshimitsu Ashikaga built this temple 
        to show his supreme authority in the Kamakura period, so it is gold and 
        gorgeous temple. On the other hand, the <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\kinkakuji_ginkakuji.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ginkaku-Ji (Silver Temple) (Figure5)</a> built 
        by Yoshimasa Ashikaga in the Kamakura period is frugal but pioneered the 
        Japanese traditional architectural system. Both temples are World Heritage 
        Site, but the contrast between Kinkaku-Ji and Ginkaku-Ji is intriguing 
        and helpful to understand Japanese culture.

    <h2>Kendama</h2>
    <p id="passage1">
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
        <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\Kendama.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendama (Figure6)</a> can be a potential promotion of traveling for Japanese governments. 
        According to the Japan Kendama Association, Kendama is the Japanese
        <figure class="figure2">
            <img class="img2" src="..\images\Kendama.jpg" alt="Kendama">

        version of the Cup & Ball game, consisting of a handle and a spike with a ball 
        connected by a string. Though the origin of the Kendama is off public 
        debate, many think that it started in France as Bilboquet in the 16  century. After that, Kendama settled
        down in Japan and formed one of the 
        traditional Japanese cultures. Recently, thanks to Colin Sander, founder 
        of KendamaUSA, Kendama has been gradually raising its recognition in the 
        <figure class="figure1">

        USA. Whereas tricks of Kendama in Japan are often low-key, those 
        developed in the USA are relatively acrobatic. These differences of 
        tricks in other cultures mean that Kendama players can choose the way 
        they fit. For instance, tricks at beginners level like <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\furiken_todai.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Furiken (Swing In) 
        or Tōdai (Lighthouse) (Figure7)</a> would be appropriate to practice for the elderly 
        since their difficulties lie in concentration. However, tricks in an 
        aerial level like <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\inazuma.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inazuma Otoshi Ikkaiten Tōdai (Lightning drop 1-turn

        be proper for the young since their difficulties lie 
        in speed. In this way, Kendama is a traditional Japanese toy with no 
        limitation of age and gender. Besides, Kendama is easy to play with 
        compared to other major sports like soccer, baseball, and American 
        football as long as players have their Kendama. Under the COVID-19, 
        Kendama has spread online and will enable those who shut themselves 
        in their house to exercise at home. Therefore, Kendama will be one 
        of the plausible ways to allure the foreigners.
    </p>

    <h2>Anime Tourism</h2>
    <p id="passage1">
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
        The last thing the Japanese government should encourage to draw the 
        attention of foreigners is anime tourism. Japanese anime has become 
        popular because of its high quality and various genres. The sales of 
        the anime industry have increased for six years, approximately half 
        of which were from other countries (Association of Japanese Animations, 
        2019). Due to the Coronavirus, most people have spent more time at home 
        since April. Therefore, many people can have time to enjoy watching 
        anime. For example, Pocket Monster is one of the most famous Japanese 
        animations in foreign countries. Pokémon GO is also a widespread game, 
        whose players walk to catch rare Pokémon on their smartphone. Therefore, 
        Pokémon GO can be one of the incentives for travelers to visit Japan by 
        setting regionally limited Pokémon for enthusiastic fans. Also, it is 
        one of the new styles of tourism to go to a real-life anime location. 
        By manufacturing anime goods for foreign fans limited to the area, anime 
        pilgrimage will promote the local economy.
    </p>

    <h2>Beyond the Barrier of Language</h2>
    <p id="passage1">
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
        While there is an enormous potential for Japanese tourism, some 
        foreigners are reluctant to visit Japan because of the barrier of 
        languages. Nevertheless, this argument can be refutable. Firstly, 
        Japanese governments and corporations have introduced a 
        <figure class="figure1">
            <img class="img1" src="..\images\shinjuku.jpg" alt="the multilingual display at Shinjuku station">
            <br>
            <p class="pcenter">
                <a class="a1" href="..\HTML\shinjuku.html"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figure9 Multilingual display</a>
            </p>
        </figure>
        <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\shinjuku.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multilingual display (Figure9)</a>and 
        <a class="a2" href="..\HTML\multi_sound.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sound for English, Korean, and Chinese</a>.
        Transportations, hotels, and 
        tourist spots are the principal place where Japanese people should 
        support multi-languages. More than 95 percent of the homepage of the 
        subway and bus in Japan is compatible with English (Japanese Tourism 
        Agency, 2020). Therefore, travelers can check the appropriate route in 
        English. Plus, most of the main transportations like airplanes and 
        bullet trains are compatible with a foreign language in response to the 
        increase of Japanese tourism. Japanese hotels and tourist sites have 
        also improved multilingual support due to the Tokyo Olympic and 
        Paralympic. Secondly, most Japanese will kindly try to show the way, 
        if spoken, although Japanese people are not good at speaking English. 
        Consequently, travelers can experience the politeness and kindness of 
        Japanese people. Thus, the “barrier of the languages” argument does not 
        stand to think about multilingual support and Japanese tenderness.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p id="passage1">
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
        In conclusion, delicious food, hot springs, historical sites, Kendama, 
        and anime pilgrimage are the main reasonable promotions for the Japanese 
        government to attract foreign tourists. The former two are for people 
        whose purposes are to have relaxed while the latter three are for people 
        who want to experience traditional and present Japanese cultures. Japan 
        has also become more compatible with foreign languages. By promoting the 
        above five things, Japan will be more famous for its humble and graceful 
        culture.
